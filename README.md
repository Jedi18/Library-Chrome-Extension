# Library-Chrome-Extension


## Description
AITians have been paying a lot of fine just because of forgetting to re-issue the library books. Paying just because you have a bad memory doesn't seems to right isn't it? This project aims at solving this particular problem. 

We plan to build a Google Chrome extension that will scrape the details of book that you issued from the library and will notify you about the re-issue date at appropriate time and will reissue the book on a click from the extension itself. Seems exiciting, isn't it?

## Additional Information
Work to be done would be:
- To develop a google chrome extension which will take login details of library portal, will notify the user about the date of re-issue and will provide a button for re-issuing.

- To write a python/javascript code for scraping the webpage of library portal.

- To extend support for notifying through e-mail.

## Desirable Skills
Familiarity with html,css , javascript and preferably with developing chrome extensions. Knowledge of web-scraping using python or javscript.

## Difficulty
Medium
